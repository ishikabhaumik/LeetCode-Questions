# Binary Search
# Intuition: Used for searching elements in a fixed search space and a ordered search space
# take high = n-1 low =0 and mid= (low+high)/2. You compare if mid is less than the target then low moves mid +1 same if the mid is more than the target than high = mid-1; everytime the mid is clauclated

    // Perform the steps:

        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (target > nums[mid]) low = mid + 1;
